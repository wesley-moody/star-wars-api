        Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
        Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him? <br />
        <br />
        He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just
        not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's
        boasting, we ought to do well. <br />
        <br />
        Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet
        that it's farthest from. I see, sir. Uh, you can call me Luke. I see,
        sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and
        this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon
        scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all
        we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as
        we are, what with the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion
        against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service, if you
        take my meaning, sir. <br />
        Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate
        sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies
        to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die
        before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal
        and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! <br />
        <br />
        Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no
        transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the
        fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans
        in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it
        personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes,
        sir.
        <br />
        <br />
        That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me
        into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A
        transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's
        you! It's you!
