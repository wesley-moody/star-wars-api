# Star wars API

### Created using Create-React-App
Desigined this project from scratch to practice pulling data from API's.

Designed the project using async functions to be able to pull multiple pieces of data at the same time.

Initially pulled data using fetch, then refactored using Axios.get for cleaner code and learned it contains better error handling, which will become far more important on projects that will scale.
